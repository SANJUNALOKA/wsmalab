Web social media analysis involves the collection, monitoring, and interpretation of data from social networking platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn to gain insights into user behavior, trends, sentiment, and engagement. It uses techniques such as natural language processing, sentiment analysis, and data mining to understand public opinion, brand perception, and market trends. This analysis helps businesses, researchers, and organizations make data-driven decisions, improve marketing strategies, and monitor brand reputation in real time. Tools like Hootsuite, Brandwatch, and Sprout Social are commonly used for this purpose.
